# Expo EAS Build Failure: `Error: Command failed: npx expo prebuild`

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered during the Expo EAS Build process. The build process fails with the error message `Error: Command failed: npx expo prebuild --public-url=/expo/my-app`.  The issue arises from a configuration problem within the `eas.json` file or from dependency conflicts.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Attempt to build the app using EAS Build: `eas build --platform ios` (or android)

This will likely result in the reported error.

## Solution

The solution involves reviewing and correcting the `eas.json` file and resolving any conflicting dependencies. The `bugSolution.js` file in this repository shows how the `eas.json` file should be correctly structured for successful builds.
