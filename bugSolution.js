The solution involves checking the `eas.json` file to ensure it's correctly configured, specifically focusing on the `build` section.  If you are using a custom build script, ensure it is correctly set up and there are no errors within it. Also, review your package.json for conflicting dependencies and resolve those conflicts. The `eas.json` configuration may need to specify a custom public URL or ensure that the project's directory structure is correctly configured.  Also ensure that you have properly set up the necessary build environment variables.
